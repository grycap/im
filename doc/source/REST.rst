IM REST API
===========

Optionally, IM Service can be accessed through a REST(ful) API. The port number
and the security settings are controlled by the options listed in
:ref:`options-rest`.

In the following link you can follow the IM REST API in Swaggerhub: 
`Swagger API <https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/grycap/InfrastructureManager/>`_.

Every HTTP request must be accompanied by the header ``AUTHORIZATION`` with
the content of the :ref:`auth-file`, but putting all the elements in one line
using "\\n" as separator. If the content cannot be parsed successfully, or the user and
password are not valid, it is returned the HTTP error code 401.

Next tables summaries the resources and the HTTP methods available.

The error message returned by the service will depend on the ``Accept`` header of the request:

* text/plain: (default option).
* application/json: The request has a "Accept" header with value "application/json". In this case the format will be::

    {
      "message": "Error message text",
      "code" : 400
     }
     
* text/html: The request has a "Accept" with value to "text/html".

   to the infrastructure with ID ``infId``. 
   Using RADL the RADL restrictions are the same as in :ref:`RPC-XML AddResource <addresource-xmlrpc>`.
   
   Using TOSCA as input this method can be used to add or remove resources depending on the number of
   resources specified in the new TOSCA document sent. If new nodes are added in the body compared with the
   last TOSCA sent to the IM, these new nodes will be added. For example an infrastructure has been created
   with this TOSCA document: `tosca_create.yml <https://github.com/grycap/im/blob/master/test/files/tosca_create.yml>`_
   it launches one DB server and one Web server. If this TOSCA document is sent as body of this POST function: 
   `tosca_add.yml <https://github.com/grycap/im/blob/master/test/files/tosca_add.yml>`_, a new web server will be
   added as the number of web servers has been increased to two (``count`` parameter of ``scalable`` capability).
   However if this document is sent after the node addition (the number of web servers will be two):
   `tosca_remove.yml <https://github.com/grycap/im/blob/master/test/files/tosca_remove.yml>`_
   , a web server (the VM with the ID ``2`` as specified in the ``removal_list`` parameter) will be removed.

   If success, it is returned a list of URIs of the new virtual machines. The ``context`` parameter is
   optional and is a flag to specify if the contextualization step will be launched just after the VM
   addition. Acceptable values: yes, no, true, false, 1 or 0. If not specified the flag is set to True. 
   The result is JSON format has the following format::

    {
      "uri-list": [
         { "uri" : "http://server.com:8800/infrastructures/inf_id/vms/2" },
         { "uri" : "http://server.com:8800/infrastructures/inf_id/vms/3" }

   RADL are specified, the contextualization process is stated again.
