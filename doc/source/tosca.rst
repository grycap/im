TOSCA
======

The Infrastructure Manager supports the definition of Cloud topologies using `OASIS TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML Version 1.0 <http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.0/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.0.html>`_.

The TOSCA support was developed under the framework of the `INDIGO DataCloud EU project <http://http://www.indigo-datacloud.eu>`_.
You can see some input examples at 
`https://github.com/grycap/tosca/tree/main/templates <https://github.com/grycap/tosca/tree/main/templates>`_.

Basic example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This TOSCA file describes a cloud topology with 2 VM with at least 2 CPUs and
2 GB of RAM and 40 GB of root disk, connected with a public IP, using an Ubuntu
20.04 image. As outputs, the TOSCA file will return the public IP of the VM and
the SSH credentials to access it::

    tosca_definitions_version: tosca_simple_yaml_1_0

    imports:
    - indigo_custom_types: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indigo-dc/tosca-types/master/custom_types.yaml

        node_creds:
          value: { get_attribute: [ simple_node, endpoint, credential, 0 ] }

Setting VMI URI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As in RADL, you can set a specific URI identifying the VMI to use in the VM.
The URI format is the same used in RADL (:ref:`radl_system`). In this case
the type must be changed to ``tosca.nodes.indigo.Compute`` (the Compute normative
type does not support the ``os image`` property), and the image property must
be added in the ``os`` capability::

    ...

        simple_node:
          type: tosca.nodes.indigo.Compute
          capabilities:
            endpoint:
              properties:
                network_name: PUBLIC
            host:
              properties:
                num_cpus: 2
                mem_size: 2 GB
            os:
              properties:
                image: one://someserver.com/123

    ...

Advanced Compute host properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``tosca.nodes.indigo.Compute`` custom type adds a new set of advanced features to the
host properties, enabling the request of GPUs and
`Intel SGX <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/software-guard-extensions.html>`_ CPU support
in the compute node::

    ...

    simple_node:
      type: tosca.nodes.indigo.Compute
      capabilities:
        host:
          properties:
            num_cpus: 2
            mem_size: 2 GB
            num_gpus: 1
            gpu_vendor: nvidia
            gpu_model: Tesla V100
            sgx: false

    ...

Network properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basic properties
-----------------

The easiest way to specify network requirements of the Compute node is using the endpoint capability properties.
For example, the following example the compute node requests for a public IP::

    ...
        simple_node:
          type: tosca.nodes.Compute
          capabilities:
            endpoint:
              properties:
                network_name: PUBLIC
    ...

Possible values of the ``network_name`` endpoint property:

  * PRIVATE: The Compute node does not require a public IP. **This is the default behaviour if no
    endpoint capability is defined**.
  * PUBLIC: The Compute node requires a public IP.
  * Network provider ID: As the `provider_id` network property in RADL
    It defines the name of the network in a specific Cloud provider
    (see :ref:`_radl_network`):

Furthermore, the endpoint capability has a set of additional properties
to set the DNS name of the node or the set of ports to be externally accessible::

    ...

      capabilities:
        endpoint:
          properties:
            dns_name: slurmserver
            network_name: PUBLIC
            ports:
              http_port:
                protocol: tcp
                source: 80
                remote_cidr: 0.0.0.0/0 # optional

    ...

Advanced properties
-------------------

In case you need a more detailed definition of the networks, you can use the 
``tosca.nodes.network.Network`` and ``tosca.nodes.network.Port`` TOSCA normative types.
In this way you can define the set of networks needed in your topology using the ports to 
link the networks with the Compute nodes::

    ...

    pub_network:
      type: tosca.nodes.network.Network
      properties:
        network_type: public

    server_pub_port:
      type: tosca.nodes.network.Port
      properties:
        order: 1
        ip_address: X.X.X.X # optional to request specific IP
      requirements:
        - binding: simple_node
        - link: pub_network

    priv_network:
      type: tosca.nodes.network.Network
      properties:
        network_type: private

    server_port:
      type: tosca.nodes.network.Port
      properties:
        order: 0
      requirements:
        - binding: simple_node
        - link: priv_network

    ...


Custom defined Port type ``tosca.nodes.indigo.network.Port`` has a set of additional properties:

  * dns_name: DNS name to assing to the network interface.
  * additional_ip: (OpenStack specific) Additional IP to be allowed to the network interface.
  * additional_dns_names: Additional DNS names.


Software Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IM enable the use of Ansible playbooks as implementation scripts. Furthermore, it enables to specify
Ansible roles (``tosca.artifacts.AnsibleGalaxy.role``) and collections (``tosca.artifacts.AnsibleGalaxy.collections``)
to be installed and used in the playbooks::

    ...

    software:
      type: tosca.nodes.SoftwareComponent
      artifacts:
        docker_role:
          file: grycap.docker
          type: tosca.artifacts.AnsibleGalaxy.role
      requirements:
        - host: simple_node 
      interfaces:
        Standard:
          configure:
            implementation: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grycap/ec3/tosca/tosca/artifacts/dummy.yml
            inputs:
              some_input: { get_input: some_input }

    ...

Storage
^^^^^^^

IM enables the definition of BlockStorage volumes to be attached to the compute nodes.
In this example we can see how to define a volume of 10GB to be attached to the compute node
and mounted in the path /mnt/disk. The device parameter is optional and it is only needed in
some cloud providers, in general is better not to add it::

    ...

    simple_node:
      type: tosca.nodes.Compute

      ...

      requirements:
        - local_storage:
            node: my_storage
            relationship:
              type: AttachesTo
              properties:
                location: /mnt/disk
                device: hdb # optional

    my_storage:
      type: tosca.nodes.BlockStorage
      properties:
        size: 10GB

    ...

Policies & groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IM enables the definition of the specific cloud provider where the Compute nodes will be deployed in a hybrid deployment.
For example, in the following code we assume that we have defined three compute nodes (compute_one, compute_two and compute_three).
We can create a placement group with two of them (compute_one and compute_two) and then set a placement policy with a cloud_id
(that must be defined in the :ref:`auth-file`), and create a second placement policy where we can set a different cloud provider
and, optionally, an availability zone::

    ...

    groups:
      my_placement_group:
        type: tosca.groups.Root
        members: [ compute_one, compute_two ]

    policies:
      - deploy_group_on_cloudid:
        type: tosca.policies.Placement
        properties: { cloud_id: cloudid1 }
        targets: [ my_placement_group ]

      - deploy_on_cloudid:
        type: tosca.policies.Placement
        properties: { cloud_id: cloudid2, availability_zone: some_zone }
        targets: [ compute_three ]

    ...

Container Applications (Kubernetes connector)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IM also enables the definition of container applications to be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.
In the following example, we can see how to define a container application (IM) that uses a
ConfigMap for a configuration file. The IM application is connected with a MySQL backend
using the ``IM_DATA_DB`` environment variable. The MySQL container is defined with a Persistent
Volume Claim (PVC) of 10GB. Furthermore, the IM application specifies an endpoint to be published
that will result in the creation of a Kubernetes Ingress.

    ...

    node_templates:

      im_container:
        type: tosca.nodes.Container.Application.Docker
        properties:
          environment:
            IM_DATA_DB:
              concat:
                - "mysql://root:"
                - { get_input: mysql_root_password }
                - "@"
                - { get_attribute: [ mysql_container, endpoints, 0 ] }
                - "/im-db"
        requirements:

          # volume_id: "PV name"

    outputs:
      im_service_endpoint:
        value: { get_attribute: [ im_container, endpoints, 0 ] }


Advanced Output values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``tosca.nodes.indigo.Compute`` node type adds a new
attribute named: ``ansible_output``. It is a map that has one element per each IM
configuration step, so you can access it by name. The steps have the keyword
``tasks``, that is also a map that has one element per ansible task. In this case
it can be accessed using the task name as defined in the playbook. Finally
there is an ``output`` keyword that returns the output of the task.
In most of the cases the task is a ``debug`` ansible task that shows anything you
want to return.

In the following example, the specified task was a debug ansible task that shows the
value of a internally defined value::

    ...

      outputs:
        node_ip:
          value: { get_attribute: [ front, ansible_output, lrms_front_end_front_conf_front, tasks, 'grycap.nomad : nomad_secret_id', output ] }
