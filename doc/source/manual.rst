IM Service Installation
=======================

Prerequisites
-------------

IM needs at least Python 2.6 to run, as well as the next libraries:

* `The RADL parser <https://github.com/grycap/radl>`_.
* `paramiko <http://www.lag.net/paramiko/>`_, ssh2 protocol library for python
  (version 1.14 or later).
* `PyYAML <http://pyyaml.org/>`_, a YAML parser.
* `SOAPpy <http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/>`_, a full-featured SOAP library
  (we know it is not actively supported by upstream anymore).
* `Netaddr <http://pythonhosted.org/netaddr//>`_, A Python library for representing 
  and manipulating network addresses.
* `apache-libcloud <http://libcloud.apache.org/>`_ 0.17 or later is used in the
  LibCloud, OpenStack and GCE connectors.
* `boto <http://boto.readthedocs.org>`_ 2.29.0 or later is used as interface to
  Amazon EC2. It is available as package named ``python-boto`` in Debian based
  distributions. It can also be downloaded from `boto GitHub repository <https://github.com/boto/boto>`_.
  Download the file and copy the boto subdirectory into the IM install path.
* `The Bottle framework<http://bottlepy.org/>`_ , typically available
  as the 'python-bottle' package.
* `The CherryPy Web framework <http://www.cherrypy.org/>`_, typically available as the 'python-cherrypy' 
   or 'python-cherrypy3' package.

Also, IM uses `Ansible <http://www.ansible.com>`_ (1.4.2 or later) to configure the
infrastructure nodes. The current recommended version is 1.9.4 untill the 2.X versions become stable.
 
These components are usually available from the distribution repositories.
   
Finally, check the next values in the Ansible configuration file
:file:`ansible.cfg`, (usually found in :file:`/etc/ansible`)::

   [defaults]
   transport  = smart
   host_key_checking = False
   
   # For old versions 1.X
   sudo_user = root
   sudo_exe = sudo
   
   # For new versions 2.X
   become_user      = root
   become_method    = sudo
   
   [paramiko_connection]
   
   record_host_keys=False
   
   [ssh_connection]
   
   # Only in systems with OpenSSH support to ControlPersist
   ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=900s
   # In systems with older versions of OpenSSH (RHEL 6, CentOS 6, SLES 10 or SLES 11) 
   #ssh_args =
   pipelining = True

Optional Packages
-----------------

* `Spring Python <http://springpython.webfactional.com/>`_ framework is needed
  if the access to XML-RPC API is secured with SSL certificates (see
  :confval:`XMLRCP_SSL`).
  The Debian package is named ``python-springpython``.
* pyOpenSSL are needed if needed to secure the REST API
  with SSL certificates (see :confval:`REST_SSL`).
  pyOpenSSL can be installed using pip.
* `MySQL <https://www.mysql.com/>`_ is needed if the IM data is going to be stored in DB.
  (see DATA_DB configuration variable.

Installation
------------

From Pip (Recommended option)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**WARNING: In some linux old distributions (REL 6 or equivalents) you must unistall
the package python-crypto and python-paramiko before installing the IM with pip.**::

	$ rpm -e python-crypto python-paramiko --nodeps

First you need to install pip tool and some packages needed to compile some of the IM requirements.
To install them in Debian and Ubuntu based distributions, do::

    $ apt update
    $ apt install gcc python-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev python-pip sshpass python-mysqldb

In Red Hat based distributions (RHEL, CentOS, Amazon Linux, Oracle Linux,
Fedora, etc.), do::

	$ yum install epel-release
	$ yum install which gcc python-devel libffi-devel openssl-devel python-pip sshpass MySQL-python

For some problems with the dependencies of the apache-libcloud package in some systems (as ubuntu 14.04 or CentOS 6)
this package has to be installed manually::

	$ pip install backports-ssl_match_hostname

Then you only have to call the install command of the pip tool with the IM package::

	$ pip install IM

Pip will also install the, non installed, pre-requisites needed. So Ansible  1.4.2 or later will 
be installed in the system.

You must also remember to modify the ansible.cfg file setting as specified in the 
REQUISITES section.

From RPM packages (RH7)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Download the RPM package from `GitHub <https://github.com/grycap/im/releases/latest>`_. 
Also remember to download the RPM of the RADL package also from `GitHub <https://github.com/grycap/radl/releases/latest>`_. 
You must have the epel repository enabled:: 

   $ yum install epel-release
   
Then install the downloaded RPMs:: 

   $ yum localinstall IM-*.rpm RADL-*.rpm

From Deb package (Tested with Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Download the Deb package from `GitHub <https://github.com/grycap/im/releases/latest>`_
Also remember to download the Deb of the RADL package also from `GitHub <https://github.com/grycap/radl/releases/latest>`_.

In Ubuntu 14.04 there are some requisites not available for the "trusty" version or are too old, so you have to manually install them manually.
You can download it from their corresponding PPAs. But here you have some links:
 
 * python-backports.ssl-match-hostname: `download <http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/b/backports.ssl-match-hostname/python-backports.ssl-match-hostname_3.4.0.2-1_all.deb>`_
 * python-scp: `download <http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/python-scp/python-scp_0.10.2-1_all.deb>`_
 * python-libcloud: `download <http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/libc/libcloud/python-libcloud_0.20.0-1_all.deb>`_

It is also recommended to configure the Ansible PPA to install the newest versions of Ansible (see `Ansible installation <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-apt-ubuntu>`_)::

	$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
	$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
	$ sudo apt-get update

Put all the .deb files in the same directory and do::

	$ sudo dpkg -i *.deb
	$ sudo apt install -f -y

From Source
^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the dependences are installed, just download the tarball of *IM Service*
from `Download <https://github.com/grycap/im>`_, extract the 
content and move the extracted directory to the installation path (for instance
:file:`/usr/local` or :file:`/opt`)::

   $ tar xvzf IM-0.1.tar.gz
   $ sudo chown -R root:root IM-0.1.tar.gz
   $ sudo mv IM-0.1 /usr/local

Finally you must copy (or link) $IM_PATH/scripts/im file to /etc/init.d directory::

   $ sudo ln -s /usr/local/IM-0.1/scripts/im /etc/init.d

Configuration
-------------

If you want the IM Service to be started at boot time, do

1. Update the value of the variable ``IMDAEMON`` in :file:`/etc/init.d/im` file
   to the path where the IM im_service.py file is installed (e.g. /usr/local/im/im_service.py),
   or set the name of the script file (im_service.py) if the file is in the PATH
   (pip puts the im_service.py file in the PATH as default)::

   $ sudo sed -i 's/`IMDAEMON=.*/`IMDAEMON=/usr/local/IM-0.1/im_service.py'/etc/init.d/im

2. Register the service.

To do the last step on a Debian based distributions, execute::

   $ sudo sysv-rc-conf im on

if the package 'sysv-rc-conf' is not available in your distribution, execute::

   $ sudo update-rc.d im start 99 2 3 4 5 . stop 05 0 1 6 .

For Red Hat based distributions::

   $ sudo chkconfig im on

Alternatively, it can be done manually::

   $ ln -s /etc/init.d/im /etc/rc2.d/S99im
   $ ln -s /etc/init.d/im /etc/rc3.d/S99im
   $ ln -s /etc/init.d/im /etc/rc5.d/S99im
   $ ln -s /etc/init.d/im /etc/rc1.d/K05im
   $ ln -s /etc/init.d/im /etc/rc6.d/K05im

IM reads the configuration from :file:`$IM_PATH/etc/im.cfg`, and if it is not
available, does from ``/etc/im/im.cfg``. There is a template of :file:`im.cfg`
at the directory :file:`etc` on the tarball. The IM reads the values of the ``im``
section. The options are explained next.

Docker Image
============

A Docker image named `grycap/im` has been created to make easier the deployment of an IM service using the 
default configuration. Information about this image can be found here: https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/grycap/im/.

How to launch the IM service using docker::

  $ sudo docker run -d -p 8899:8899 --name im grycap/im

You can also specify an external MySQL server to store IM data using the IM_DATA_DB environment variable::
  
  $ sudo docker run -d -p 8899:8899 -e IM_DATA_DB=mysql://username:password@server/db_name --name im grycap/im
