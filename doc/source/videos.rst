IM Videos
=========

There are an Infrastructure Manager YouTube reproduction list with a set of videos with demos
of the functionality of the platform.

Currently there are two videos available, but soon more videos will be uploaded:

The first one shows how to use the IM web interface to launch a Hadoop Cluster with a 
single click in a OpenNebula on-premise cloud platform and in Amazon EC2.

The second one shows how to use the IM web interface to access `EGI FedCloud <http://www.egi.eu/infrastructure/cloud/>`_
sites using the OCCI plugin, showing also how to launch a Hadoop Cluster with a single click.
