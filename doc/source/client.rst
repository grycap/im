IM Command-line Interface (CLI)
===============================

The :program:`im_client` is a CLI client that uses XML-RPC or REST APIs of IM Server.

Installation
-------------

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :program:`im_client` needs at least Python 2.4 to run.

It is also required to install the RADL parser (`https://github.com/grycap/radl <https://github.com/grycap/radl>`_), 
available in pip as the 'RADL' package. It is also required the Python Requests library (`http://docs.python-requests.org/ <http://docs.python-requests.org/>`_) 
available as 'python-requests' in O.S. packages or 'requests' in pip.

Optional packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In case of using the SSL secured version of the XMLRPC API the SpringPython framework 
(`http://springpython.webfactional.com/ <http://springpython.webfactional.com/>`_) must be installed.

Installing
^^^^^^^^^^

From pip
++++++++

You only have to call the install command of the pip tool with the IM-client package::

	$ pip install IM-client

From source
+++++++++++

Download de source code from the Github repo: `https://github.com/grycap/im-client/releases <https://github.com/grycap/im-client/releases>`_.
Then you only need to install the tar-gziped file to any directoy::

	$ tar xvzf IM-client-X.XX.tar.gz

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To avoid typing the parameters in all the client calls. The user can define a config file "im_client.cfg" 
in the current directory or a file ".im_client.cfg" in their home directory. In the config file the 
user can specify the following parameters::

	[im_client]
	# only set one of the urls
	#xmlrpc_url=http://localhost:8899
	restapi_url=http://localhost:8800
	auth_file=auth.dat
	xmlrpc_ssl_ca_certs=/tmp/pki/ca-chain.pem

.. _auth-file:

Authorization File
------------------

The authorization file stores in plain text the credentials to access the
cloud providers, the IM service and the VMRC service. Each line of the file
is composed by pairs of key and value separated by semicolon, and refers to a
single credential. The key and value should be separated by " = ", that is
**an equals sign preceded and followed by one white space at least**, like
this::

   id = id_value ; type = value_of_type ; username = value_of_username ; password = value_of_password 

Values can contain "=", and "\\n" is replaced by carriage return. 
You can also delimit the values using single or double quotes (e.g. if a semicolon or some quote character
appear in a value)(from version 1.6.6)::

   id = id_value ; type = value_of_type ; username = value_of_username ; password = 'some;"password'
   id = id_value ; type = value_of_type ; username = value_of_username ; password = "some;'password"

The available keys are:

* ``type`` indicates the service that refers the credential. The services
  supported are ``InfrastructureManager``, ``VMRC``, ``OpenNebula``, ``EC2``,, ``FogBow``, 
  ``OpenStack``, ``OCCI``, ``LibCloud``, ``Docker``, ``GCE``, ``Azure``, ``AzureClassic``,
  ``Kubernetes`` and ``vSphere``.

* ``username`` indicates the user name associated to the credential. In EC2
  it refers to the *Access Key ID*. In GCE it refers to *Service Accountâ€™s Email Address*. 
  In CloudStack refers to Api Key value.

* ``password`` indicates the password associated to the credential. In EC2
  it refers to the *Secret Access Key*. In GCE it refers to *Service  Private Key*
  (either in JSON or PKCS12 formats). See how to get it and how to extract the private key file from
  `here info <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#service_accounts>`_).
  In CloudStack refers to Secret Key value.

* ``tenant`` indicates the tenant associated to the credential.
  This field is only used in the OpenStack plugin.

* ``host`` indicates the address of the access point to the cloud provider.
  This field is not used in IM, GCE, Azure, and EC2 credentials.
  
* ``proxy`` indicates the content of the proxy file associated to the credential.
  To refer to a file you must use the function "file(/tmp/proxyfile.pem)" as shown in the example.
  This field is used in the OCCI and OpenStack plugins. 
  
* ``project`` indicates the project name associated to the credential.
  This field is only used in the GCE or OCCI (from version 1.6.3) plugins.
  
* ``public_key`` indicates the content of the public key file associated to the credential.
  To refer to a file you must use the function "file(cert.pem)" as shown in the example.
  This field is used in the Azure Classic and Docker plugins. For Azure Classic see how to get it
  `here <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/gg551722.aspx>`_

* ``private_key`` indicates the content of the private key file associated to the credential.
  To refer to a file you must use the function "file(key.pem)" as shown in the example.
  This field is used in the Azure Classic and Docker plugins. For Azure Classic see how to get it
  `here <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/gg551722.aspx>`_

* ``id`` associates an identifier to the credential. The identifier should be
  used as the label in the *deploy* section in the RADL.

* ``subscription_id`` indicates the subscription_id name associated to the credential.
  This field is only used in the Azure and Azure Classic plugins. To create a user to use the Azure (ARM)
  plugin check the documentation of the Azure python SDK:
  `here <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/azure/python-sdk-azure-authenticate?view=azure-python>`_

* ``token`` indicates the OpenID token associated to the credential. This field is used in the OCCI plugin (from version 1.6.2). 

OpenStack additional fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OpenStack has a set of additional fields to access a cloud site:

* ``domain`` the domain name associated to the credential. The default value is: ``Default``.

* ``auth_version`` the auth version used to connect with the Keystone server.
  The possible values are: ``2.0_password``, ``2.0_voms``, ``3.x_password`` or ``3.x_oidc_access_token``.
  The default value is ``2.0_password``.

* ``api_version`` the api version used to connect with nova endpoint.
  The possible values are: ``1.0``, ``1.1``, ``2.0`, ``2.1`` or ``2.2``.
  The default value is ``2.0``.

* ``base_url`` base URL to the OpenStack API nova endpoint. By default, the connector obtains API endpoint URL from the 
  server catalog, but if this argument is provided, this step is skipped and the provided value is used directly.
  The value is: http://cloud_server.com:8774/v2/<tenant_id>.
  
* ``network_url`` base URL to the OpenStack API neutron endpoint. By default, the connector obtains API endpoint URL from the 
  server catalog, but if this argument is provided, this step is skipped and the provided value is used directly.
  The value is: http://cloud_server.com:9696.
  
* ``image_url`` base URL to the OpenStack API glance endpoint. By default, the connector obtains API endpoint URL from the 
  server catalog, but if this argument is provided, this step is skipped and the provided value is used directly.
  The value is: http://cloud_server.com:9292.
  
  * ``volume_url`` base URL to the OpenStack API cinder endpoint. By default, the connector obtains API endpoint URL from the 
  server catalog, but if this argument is provided, this step is skipped and the provided value is used directly.
  The value is: http://cloud_server.com:8776/v2/<tenant_id>.

* ``service_region`` the region of the cloud site (case sensitive). It is used to obtain the API 
  endpoint URL. The default value is: ``RegionOne``.

* ``service_name`` the service name used to obtain the API endpoint URL. The default value is: ``Compute``.
  From version 1.5.3 a special name ``None`` can be used to use a ``Null\None`` value as the service name
  as it is used for example in the Open Telekom Cloud. 

* ``auth_token`` token which is used for authentication. If this argument is provided, normal authentication 
  flow is skipped and the OpenStack API endpoint is directly hit with the provided token. Normal authentication 
  flow involves hitting the auth service (Keystone) with the provided username and password and requesting an
  authentication token.

OpenID Connect OpenStack sites
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To connect with OpenStack sites that supports `OpenID Connect <https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/pike/advanced-topics/federation/openidc.html>`_
some of the previous parameters has a diferent meaning:

* username: Specifies the identity provider.
* tenant: Specifies the authentication protocol to use (tipically ``oidc`` or ``openid``).
* password: Specifies the OpenID access token.

So the auth line will be like that::

   id = ost; type = OpenStack; host = https://ostserver:5000; username = indentity_provider; tenant = oidc; password = access_token_value; auth_version = 3.x_oidc_access_token


INDIGO specific parameters
***************************

To use the INDIGO IAM to authenticate with a Keystone server properly configured following this 
`guidelines <https://indigo-dc.gitbooks.io/openid-keystone/content/indigo-configuration.html>`_.
In this case the OpenID parameters are the following:

* username: ``indigo-dc``.
* tenant: ``oidc``.
* password: Specifies the INDIGO IAM access token.

So the auth line will be like that::

   id = ost; type = OpenStack; host = https://ostserver:5000; username = indigo-dc; tenant = oidc; password = iam_token_value; auth_version = 3.x_oidc_access_token

EGI FedCloud specific parameters
*******************************

To use the EGI CheckIn to authenticate with a Keystone server properly configured the parameters are the following (see
more info at `EGI Documentation <https://egi-federated-cloud-integration.readthedocs.io/en/latest/openstack.html#cli-access>`_):

* username: ``egi.eu``.
* tenant: ``openid``.
* password: Specifies the EGI CheckIn access token.
* domain: Specifies the OpenStack project to use. This parameter is optional. If not set the first project returned
  by Keystone will be selected.

So the auth line will be like that::

   id = ost; type = OpenStack; host = https://ostserver:5000; username = egi.eu; tenant = openid; password = egi_aai_token_value; auth_version = 3.x_oidc_access_token; domain = project_name


Open Telekom Cloud
++++++++++++++++++

The Open Telekom Cloud (OTC) is the cloud provided by T-Systems. It is based on OpenStack and it can be accessed
using the OpenStack IM connector using an authorization line similar to the following example::

   id = otc; type = OpenStack; host = https://iam.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com:443 ; username = user; password = pass; tenant = tenant; domain = domain; auth_version = 3.x_password; service_name = None; service_region = eu-de

You can get the username, password, tenant and domain values from the ``My Credentials`` section of your OTC access. 

Examples
^^^^^^^^

An example of the auth file::

   # OpenNebula site
   id = one; type = OpenNebula; host = osenserver:2633; username = user; password = pass
   # OpenStack site using standard user, password, tenant format

   id = ostvoms; type = OpenStack; proxy = file(/tmp/proxy.pem); host = https://keystone:5000; tenant = tname
   #  OpenStack site using OpenID authentication
   id = ost; type = OpenStack; host = https://ostserver:5000; username = indentity_provider; tenant = oidc; password = access_token_value; auth_version = 3.x_oidc_access_token

   # Docker site with certificates
   id = docker; type = Docker; host = http://host:2375; public_key = file(/tmp/cert.pem); private_key = file(/tmp/key.pem)
   # Docker site without SSL security
   id = docker; type = Docker; host = http://host:2375
   # OCCI VOMS site auth data
   id = occi; type = OCCI; proxy = file(/tmp/proxy.pem); host = https://server.com:11443
   # OCCI OIDC site auth data
   id = occi; type = OCCI; token = token; host = https://server.com:11443
   # Azure (RM) site auth data
   id = azure; type = Azure; subscription_id = subscription-id; username = user@domain.com; password = pass
   # Kubernetes site auth data
   id = kub; type = Kubernetes; host = http://server:8080; token = auth_token
   # FogBow auth data
   id = fog; type = FogBow; host = http://server:8182; proxy = file(/tmp/proxy.pem)
   # Azure Classic auth data
   id = azurecla; type = AzureClassic; subscription_id = subscription_id; public_key = file(/tmp/cert.pem); private_key = file(/tmp/key.pem)
   # vSphere site auth data
   id = vsphere; type = vSphere; host = http://server; username = user; password = pass
   # CloudStack site auth data
   id = cloudstack; type = CloudStack; host = http://server; username = apikey; password = secret
   

IM Server does not store the credentials used in the creation of
infrastructures. Then the user has to provide them in every call of
:program:`im_client`.
